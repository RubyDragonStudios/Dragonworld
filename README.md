## Modpack Version Standards

`MODNAME [MINECRAFT] VERSION`
 
* MODNAME 	Can be any name used for the modpack. Should start with Dragonworld for any of the worlds run on Killer's server.
* MINECRAFT 	A number contained within [], this would be the version of Minecraft the modpack was built for.
* VERSION 	This is the version of the modpack consisting of 3 sets of numbers separated by periods.

`##.##.## = SEED.PACK.CONFIG`
 
* `## 	SEED 	The first set of numbers represents the seed version for the pack. This only gets changed if the world is reseeded.`
* `## 	PACK 	Mod list version. This gets changed whenever a whole mod is added or removed from the pack requiring the distribution of a new download.`
* `## 	CONFIG 	This is the configuration subversion. This number gets changed when the only changes to the pack are changes to the mod config files which require a new distribution of the pack.`
